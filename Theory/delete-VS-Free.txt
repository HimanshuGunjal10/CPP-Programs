C++ delete 	- for new operator
C 	free	- for malloc 

delete
is an operator
deallocates memory in heap
but the pointer is now a dangling pointer
so make it point to null

delete temp;
temp = nullptr;



free 
is a function
free(temp)



 if you don't set deleted pointers to 0, you will get into trouble if you're doing double deletes.
