UART:Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter

A crystal oscillator is typically used to drive a processor's clock.
External crystal oscillator clocks are 20Mhz or less.
So use a 4MHz clock and use anb internal multiplier to get 96MHz from it.
	for processor - 96 MHz
	for other peripherals - use a divider to get a lower frequency

PLL(phase Locked Loop) - Control system - takes a reference freq and creates a higher freq
To get a lower frequency, its better to use a freq divider rather than a PLL

High frequency signals will be distorted due to:
	Series inductance of board traces
	Parallel capacitance due to board copper areas and fiber glass
	Interference from other external signals like power signals and switching signals
	Signal distortion may cause the MCU to malfunction.

UART
3 wires = fully duplex (Rx Tx) and GND (****)
One to One communication
	No address required
	No master/slave
	Baud rates of Tx and Rx must match. (typically 9600bps)

UART Frame (****)
10 bits
	8 bit payload
	2 bits overhead (start and stop bits)
	optional parity bits

Note: Usually uart0 is comprimised and dedicatedly serves for connecting the PC and uC for programming.

Benefits:
	Low h/w complexity
	no clock
	no device addressing required as 1 to 1

Cons:
	8 bits max payload
	no master/slave
	baud rates muct be same (usually 10% tolerance accepted0)
